    <h2>Real quote from someone famous</h2>
    <blockquote>this isnt even a real quote</blockquote>
    <p>I wish i was a <em>wizzard</em>. turning my enemies into <em>gizzard</em>, of a <em>chicken</em>. 
        Name my first <em>potion</em> the <em>fizzward</em>.
         Then the plot would really <em>thicken</em>. 
         By now you would hopefully get the <em>notion</em> that i am not a <em><mark>wizzard</mark></em>.
         tired of all the people trying to make me feeble. Sick of all these fools making me want to drool. 
         want to feel cool just to me. standing straighter then a tree. jump into the pool of my mind as i waste all my time
         if I know one thing its that life sure is cruel. 
        </p>
