    <h1>Questions:</h1>
    <h2>What is the best way to ensure you get a good grade on projects?</h2>
    <p>Projects are like our tests. Make sure we got our html correct. This means using tags correctly, not graded on what our websites look like.</p>
    <h2>When is your project due?</h2>
    <p>Monday. Projects will typically be due before we go to bed Monday night.</p>
    <h2>What are special entity characters</h2>
    <p>Special characters within html that are not found on a traditional keyboard. Each special entity character has a number and a name and either one can be used
        to print the character desired.They all start with a & and end with a ;. </p>
    <h2>What is the difference between OL and UL Tags</h2>
    <p>Ordered Lists (OL), will sort lists into a predescribed orderd. The order in these lists does matter.
         Unordered Lists (UL), will not sort the items on a list. There is no ranking system or other way of numbering the list. </p>
