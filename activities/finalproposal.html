    <header><h1>Final Proposal</h1></header>
    <body>
        <p>My final project is going to be about artist I believe deserve more recongition. The title will be "Artists that need more spotlight". I am very passionate about this subject as listening to music is one of my favorite hobbies. I also believe to have a well rounded mix of artists that are smaller despite their ovbious skill. There is also lots of numbers and data that should be easy to documnt and make tables of.</p>
        <p>My first page will show a brief overview of the arists I have selected. I will also have the form on this page to ask the viewer if they have heard of or listen to any of the artist. I may also have an option to submit reccomendations or other artist the viewer believes should be more recognized. My next four pages will highlight different artists. The first is Earl Sweatshirt. The second is Sleater-Kinney. The third is JPEGMAFIA. My final artist is Indigo De Souza. My fifth page will be a conclusion and feature the table on listener numbers and album review scores. The two refrences I am going to use is an article from the New York Times on earl sweatshirt not wanting big fame. I will also be referencing Pitchfork and The Needle Drop for album scores and review. I acknowledge that I have read the warnings and will not plagiarize.  </p>
