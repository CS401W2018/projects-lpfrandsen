        <h2>Questions</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Youtube will host your own videos for free. The downside is that it will suggest other videos after playing. There will also be ads.</li>
            <li>I would say the most useful thing you could do with a transform is to scale an Image.</li>
            <li></li>
            <li>The rest of the class will go as follows: We will not have any more projects in this class. The final will be due in two mondays from now. We will have a practice test next Monday and the real test next Wednesday. The last day of class is when we will present our final projects to the class. A week from today we will need to have 3 pages done. In two weeks there will be another check up and we will have to have 5/6 pages done. </li>
