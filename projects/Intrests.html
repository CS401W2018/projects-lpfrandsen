<p>I love the Seattle Mariners. I was born and raised in Bremerton which is a 45 minute ferry ride to Seattle.
My family all loves the Mariners and I was raised on stories of my dad and his brothers going to games all throughout their childhood.
While the team has had little success and are currently going through a trial of unfaith in our orginization's staff, I will always be down to catch a game.

  Ever since I was a little kid baseball was my favorite sport. My parents tell me how I was focused on the game as a young kid while 
  my peers would be distracted. Like any other baseball player I dreamed of playing in the big leagues for my home team. The Mariners
  will forever hold a place in my heart for introdcing me to my favorite sport and I plan on following them for the rest of my life.
