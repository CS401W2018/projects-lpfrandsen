       <p>My family has several christmas traditions. We go to my grandparents on christmas eve and christmas day. We share our testimonies of Jesus and mess around with candles using paper clips. But my favorite tradition happens on christmas eve. Me and my siblings sleep in one room for a big sleepover and play What Remains of Edith Finch from start to finish. This video game has always held a special place in my heart for this reason. <br><br>Despite the special reasons for playing this game I love it with all my heart. My sisters feel the same way which makes it a special night for all of us to enjoy. Me and my family look forward to this time all year as a time to feel joy all together.  </p>
