    <p>The Space Needle is one the most iconic landmarks in Seattle. The design was drawn on a napkin in a resteraunt and built for a world fair.
The Space Needle is easily the most recognizable building in the Seattle sky line and is a very popular tourist detination. There was originall a resteraunt at the top
of needle and would rotate slowly to give guests a changing view of the surrounding city and puget sound. This was recently removed but is still one of the more 
visited tourist destinations in Seattle.
