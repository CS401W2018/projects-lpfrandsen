    <h2>What this tour is about:</h2>
    <p>This tour will take you all across popular tourist locations throughout the city of Seattle.
        All locations are within a close enough location you could see all of them in real life in a day.
        I am from Bremerton which is a ferry ride away from Seattle so I have chosen some of my favorite spots in the city.
