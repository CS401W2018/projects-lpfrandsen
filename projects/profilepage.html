    <p1>Hello! Something you should know about me is how important sports have been in my life. I can't remember a time I wasn't
        actively playing or following a sport. I have had the oppritunity to play many sports in my life and I am very grateful for that.
        In highschool I played Soccer, Basketball, Baseball, and Tennis.

    Another big part of my life is music. While I don't currently play any instruments (very well atleast), I still think of myself 
    as a musicaly inclined person. I listen to as much music as I possibly can and have always have noticed how it can transform a day.
    I often find myself getting emotionally connected to music, specifically albums. While I pride myself of being able to apprecieate most 
    music, my favorite genres and hip hop, rock, and r&b.
