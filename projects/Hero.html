<p>JP Crawford has been my facorite player for the Mariners for a couple years now. I love the way he carries himself on and off the field.
    He is a supportive team mate, strong leader, and someone I would love to play with. I greatly apprecieate the value he brings to the team
    and have always looked up to him.
