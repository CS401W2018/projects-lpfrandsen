        </div>
        <div class="flex">
            <p class="main">Barringtion Hendricks, or Jpegmafia has maybe the most intense history out of all the artists featured on this site. He has Jamaican parents and moved around a lot as a kid. While he spent most of his time in Brooklyn, he later lived in Alabama. During his time in Alabama he experienced racism firsthand and this would seriously influence his art later in life. His childhood was very troubled as he was sexually, physically, and verbally abused. Straight after highschool he joined the Air Force. He served a tour in Iraq as well as a few other placed before being honroable discharged for speaking out against his superiors (<a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JPEGMafia">link</a>). Jpegmafia, or Peggy as fans call him, started producing beats at 15. His production was extremely unique and often left people confused. Because of this he started rapping on his own beats. He continued to work on his music throughout highschool and during his time in the military. He released a couple albums through the name Devon Hendryx during his stay in Japan with the military. After being discharged he moved to Baltimore and started releasing mixtapes under his new name, Jpegmafia. He released his first album in 2016.   </p>

                <h3 class="green">His Sound and Rec's</h3>
                <p class="green">Jpegmafia might have the most unique sound in hip hop. His production style is entirely original with nothing really to compare it to except maybe death grips. It has almost a punk feel to the rap like hes rebelling against everyone and everything. He layers hard hitting mosh pit style moments with heart felt soft singing. His production is unpredictable and one of a kind. His music is the definition of an aquired taste as most find it hard to listen to. Despite this Jpegmafia has a massive cult like fan base. I would reccomend the albums "Offline", and "Scaring the Hoes", as well as the single, "Baby im Bleeding."</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flex">
            <p class="main">Jpegmafia is so special because he produces mixes and masters all of his own music. few rappers are creatively inspired enough to create a beat for every single one of their songs. Peggy is constantly praised and featured on best music of the year lists from organizations like Pitchfork, NPR, and The Rolling Stone. Outside the world of music critics Jpegmafia does not have much mainstream success and it is apparent that this is on purpose. He has brought up how little he thinks of the worlds opinion on his music on mutliple tracks and interviews. Peggy has had huge success touring and playing live shows. His energetic music and intense personality pair together for eletric shows.  </p>

            <h2 class="purp">Summary</h2>
        </div>
        <div class="flex">
            <p class="main">Jpegmafia is on this site for multiple reasons. His talent in rapping, singing, and producing is very impressive. He has such an original view to music and is constatnly redefining boundaries. His rough childhood and upbringing gave him such a uniqiue perspective on the world. Peggy has no fear in discussing his opinions in songs and often goes over topics like racism, sexism, individuality, and the absurdity of politics. His anoplegitcally bold style has set a new wave of boundary pushing artists. The authentic and original style will be remembered in music history for changing things up along with other genre redefinging artists like Death Grips.  </p>
