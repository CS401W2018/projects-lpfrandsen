        </div>
        <div class="flex">
            <p class="main">Thebe Kgotsitsile, or Earl Sweatshirt was born on Febuary 24, 1994. Son to Keorapetse Kgotsitsile and Cheryl Harris. His father is a famous African poet and social activist who left Thebe and his mother when he was 6. His mother is a law proffesor at UCLA. After the release of his first mixtape, Cheryl sent him to a boarding school in Samoa for troubled and at-risk youth. Before leaving he was an original member of the group Odd Future. While he was gone Odd Future rose to fame creating the "free earl" movement. Fans tried many methods of getting Earl to return but his hiatus still lasted a year. He returned with his now classic album, "Doris".</p>

                <p class="green">Earl Seatshirt is known for his minimalistic production style and consistent cadence and delivery. He truly sounds like a poet with his delivery and expert lyriscism. Widely known in the underground rap scene for his clever and introspective rhymes. I would reccomend "Some Rap Songs" and the single "E.Coli" </p>

            <h2 class="purp">Noticable Accomplishments</h2>
        </div>
        <div class="flex">
            <p class="main">"Some Rap Songs" is considered by many to be on the greatest underground rap albums of all time. His time with Odd Future helped him find huge success along with so many other big names today, such as Tyler the Creator, Frank Ocean, Steve Lacy, and the Internet. His success started from a young age with his debut mixtape "Earl" when he was just 16. His year and a half break from music in Samoa did not dampen his creative goals and returned with critically acclaimed album after critically acclaimed album. </p>

            <h2 class="purp">Summary</h2>
        </div>
        <div class="flex">
            <p class="main">Ismail Muhammed from the New York times said, "One way to think of Sweatshirt's music is as a map of complex joy" (<a class="link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/03/11/magazine/earl-sweatshirt.html">Link</a>). Earl Sweatshirt articulates his way through intense topics like his mental health, dealing with grief, and family problems. He uses music as a medicine and has stated that his goal is not to get big. He makes the music he wants and needs to make. His experimental sound has inspired a whole generation of rappers using minimalistic beats and introspective lyrics. From his provactive time in Odd Future to his emotionally dense later years Earls legacy deserves to be remembered. </p>
