        </div>
        <div class="flex">
            <p class="main">Sleater-Kinney is an incredibly influential punk rock band. They were formed in 1994 in Olympia, Washington. The members include Carrie Brownstein, Corin Tucker, and various drummers throughout the bands career. The most notable drummer was Janet Weiss. The band name came from a road in Olympia, where they would originally practice. Known for discussing points like social justice, gender, and womens rights they became an icon during the riot grrrl time period. The band took a haitus from 2006 - 2015. </p>

                <h3 class="green">Their Sound and Rec's</h3>
                <p class="green">Sleater-Kinney is known for their energetic powerful punky rock sound. They famously use two guitars without a bass giving them a unique sound in the rock world. I would reccomend starting with albums like "Dig Me Out" or "The Woods". I would also reccomend the singles "Modern Girl" and "Jumpers". </p>

        </div>
        <div class="flex">
            <p class="main">Overall Sleater-Kinney is an awesome high energy punk band that is not afraid of what they have to say. They have been able to maintain mainstream success to a humble degree while still staying true to their artistic goals, a task not many accomplish. They have inspired and influenced rock for decades and deserve to be recognized as such.</p>
