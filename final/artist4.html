        </div>
        <div class="flex">
            <p class="main">Indigo De Souza is an american-brazillian indie artist out of North Carolina. She was raised in a musical household as her father was a novie musician. Her mother is also artistic and paints the cover art for her albums. Indigo started young while she learned to play the guitar at 9. While her musical carreer is just beggining she has shown promise and extreme potential with her first three projects. Her first release, "I Love my Mom", in 2018 gained her a small but loyal fanbase imediately. She continued to show ver versatility and change in her sound in the next two released which brought more of a widespread fan base. Her breakthrough is mostly credited to her second release and first through a studio as she signed with Saddle Creek Records in 2021.</p>

                <h3 class="green">Her Sound and Rec's</h3>
                <p class="green">Indigo De Souza like Adrianne Lenker has captured a very emotionally raw and intimate sound. Often touching on themes like self acceptance, heatbreak, existential crisis, and identity, she is often emotionally unfiltered.Her sound is hard to describe as it blends so many genres. Her songs often have soft heart felt singing with all out band production choruses for a climax. She comes off as very authentic and honest with her lyrics making songs very relatable to the human experience. I would reccomend her first album, "I Love my Mom" and singles "Kill Me", and "Good Heart".</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flex">
            <p class="main">Indigo has self produced her entire first album and EP. The quality of the album shows her determination to make art and achieve her goals. Signing with Saddle Creek Records in 2021 marked a big turning point in her carreer as she finds a bigger audience. The record company re-released her first self released album which kickstarted her carreer by allowing her music to reach a larger audience. While she is very young in her carreer and has the smallest following out of the artists I have selected I strongly suspect she will do great things someday. She has huge potential and strong artist integrity which show a lot of promise.</p>

            <h2 class="purp">Summary</h2>
        </div>
        <div class="flex">
            <p class="main">Indigo De Souza is a perfect example of young artist with lots of promise. She has captured the attention in the indie rock scene with only three albums released so far. Her latest release was the most introspective and experimental album yet showing how she is growing into her own sounds and exploring her limits. This is the recipe of an artist that will do big things in their carreer. Her straightforward approach to discussing topics that mean a lot to her is a good sign that she will stay true and continue to release music with artistic integrity. Indigos fearless vulnerability has allowed her to be respected by critics and fans alike. She is inspiring a generation of indie rock bedroom pop musicians with potential to do even greater things.  </p>
