        </div>
        <div class="flex">
            <p class="main">Adrianne Lenker began working on her craft from a young age. She was born into a musical family and wrote her first song at age 8. During her teens she showed an interest in guitar and more specifically, finger picking. She went on to recieve a full ride scholarship to Berklee College of Music. During her time here, she focused her education on song writing while she continued to develop her finger picking style. in 2015 she formed indie folk band Big Thief. The band consisted of Buck Meek (guitar), James Krivchenia (drums), Max Oleartchik (bass), and Adrianne as the front women. Big Thief has had huge success both in the mainstream music world as they have recieved grammy nominations, but also critically. Adrianne also has had success in her solo carreer as she has released 5 studio albums, all met with praise from critics for their raw and emotional story telling and insight to her emotions. </p>

                <h3 class="green">Her Sound and Rec's</h3>
                <p class="green">Adrianne Lenker has a very unique sound in the indie music world. She uses lots of metaphors and imagary to create very poetic lyrics that are full of meaning and emotion. She often explores themes like nature, love, and relatinships. Most of her solo work pairs her powerful lyricism with minimalistic accoustic guitar and her well known fingerpicking techniques. Adrianne's sound is intimate and creates a big atmosphere. From her solo work I would reccomend the album "Songs" and the song, "Ingydar".</p>
