            <p class="main">There are countless artists in the world today doing much more for their art and craft then the world gives them credit for. These musicians usually have a strong and loyal fan base. They also often push musical boundaries through experimentation and defying genre stearotypes. They are loyal to their music and creative intentions even when it means straying from current trends and popularity. I have tried to select artists that match these descriptions. The five artists I have selected are Sleater-Kinney, Earl Sweatshirt, Adrianne Lenker, Indigo de Souza, and Jpegmafia. </p>
