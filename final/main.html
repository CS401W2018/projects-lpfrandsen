            <p class="main">There are countless artists in the world today doing much more for their art and craft then the world gives them credit for. These musicians usually have a strong and loyal fan base. They also often push musical boundaries through experimentation and defying genre stearotypes. They are loyal to their music and creative intentions even when it means straying from current trends and popularity. I have tried to select artists that match these descriptions. The five artists I have selected are Sleater-Kinney, Earl Sweatshirt, Adrianne Lenker, Indigo de Souza, and Jpegmafia. While I am very biased and have selected artists that I favor, I have tried my best to use outside sources to strengthen my claim.</p>

            <p class="close">Above is my table about the artists I have selected. I have used <a class="link" href="https://open.spotify.com/">Spotify</a> to measure the monthly listeners. You can tell these artists are by no means unheard of and have respectable followings. They each have created a strong fan base within their own respective genres and sounds. I have used <a class="link" href="https://pitchfork.com/">Pitchfork</a> to get album scores. While music is obviously relative and each person is entitled to their own opinions, pitchfork is a very popular and somewhat reputable source for album reviews. While I definetly disagree with a lot of their scores I felt this would still be the best way to convey a respectable unbiased opinion on the music.</p>
